# Introduction

TipoTapp allows you to create several applications. Each application that you create will own its data and will also be isolated from other applications.
To guide you in creating your application on TipoTapp, we have provided a thorough manual that has been divided into several sections as seen on the menu on the left panel. This first guide, (the Quickstart) will cover the basics of creating and launching an application. It will not cover everything there is to know about this process.  

The TipoTapp interface can be a bit complex, so it will be overwhelming if we presented everything to you at once. Information will be presented to you in a need-to-know basis, enough for you to complete the task at hand. Think of it as a Crash Course that will get you from zero to launching an application as quickly as possible. The other sections of the documentation will give you an in-depth understanding of TipoTappâ€™s features.

This **`Quickstart`**, will cover:

1. How to create an application  
2. How to add data objects (Tipos) to the app, specify the fields each 
Tipo will contain and the type of 
data that will be stored in the field
3. How to add data (records) to the app
4. How to customize the appearance of the app. This will range from customizing how the app looks (logo, font, colours) to customizing other aspects such as how data is displayed and the appearance of forms
5. How to customize email templates
6. How to invite users to the application
7. How to use a custon domain for your application
